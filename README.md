# scala

## 0 - Recursive functions
Practice code from courses.
SBT-based.

## 1 - Random Scripts
Code snippets to test some scala functionalities while doing courses or exploring topics. 
Thise scripts are developed in a Databricks environment, so do not expect the traditional structure of a scala project.

## 2 - Databricks
Code developed to run data engineering workloads in a Databricks environment. At this moment expect just source code.

## 3 - Wikipedia
Analysing wikipedia articles in order to find relevant / trending programming languages.
This is done as part of a course on Coursera.
